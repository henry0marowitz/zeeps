A social media platform game that demonstrates rumours, sorting, and affective polarization

This world is populated by zeeps. These zeeps are very polarized

You start by answering a series of questions where you are simply asked what you like more, and then you click either one or the other, or indifferent. Some of these are benign opinions like apples versus grapes, others are overtly political like private versus public healthcare for zeeps You are then assigned a political affiliation, you are either a glorp or a splink.

Once you answer the questions, the policies of the glorps and splinks as well as their opinions are set to be in line with what you answered. 



The coded questions are as follows:
Dogs or Cats
City or countryside
Breakfast or dinner
Movies or TV shows
Water or soda

The political questions are as follows:
High taxes or low taxes
More Zeep Buses or Better Zeep Highways
Rent control or free market housing
Public schools or private schools
More unions or more corporate autonomy

After you answer these questions, you are shown whether you are glorp or splink, the website should associate the coded opinions you agreed with with the party you are assigned to, as well as the political questions. What I mean is your answers to the questions will determine the opinions and policy positions of the glorps and the splinks. Like the glorps and splinks have no inherent side, the user determines who and what they like. 

You are then shown posts, which are basically tweets, with a handle and then content. You then have to click on a number 1:9 to show how much you like or dislike the post

You are then shown posts, which are basically tweets, with a handle and then content. You then have to click on a number 1:9 to show how much you like or dislike the post.

These posts contain both content, as well as a handle and a profile picture prominently displayed.

Posts are either neutral, glorp coded, splink coded, pro glorp, or pro splink. At the bottom of a post, it will show one zeep who liked the content

An example post might be: 
“Zeeps who want higher taxes are like dogs who beg for boiling water. “
This post is about a policy, which means it is either pro-glorp or pro splink, depending on the user's assigned party and their answers to the policy questions.

This means that there will be a database of posts, where the posts are not assigned to a specific zeep, they are simply assigned to an answer to a question. For example this post would be pro lower taxes. If a user answers that they like lower taxes, and they are assigned glorp, this means that this post would be assigned “Pro Glorp”, and would be posted by a zeep such as Pilgus

When you design the database, I think 

These handles and profile pictures are the users, there are 15 of these, with different traits. Each zeep should have 6 posts, divided equally between their traits

After you scroll through all the posts, you are asked another set of questions about your opinions of each of the zeeps. You first have to sort the zeeps into glorp, splink, or neutral. 

After you sort all the zeeps, you are shown their actual affiliations, aligned with how you ranked them, and your average rating for their posts. 

The design for this whole website should be simple, and clean. Use a popular framework to build it, and a popular database schema. I feel like the nature of the data would lend itself to json, but do what you think is best.
